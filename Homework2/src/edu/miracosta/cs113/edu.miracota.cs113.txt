How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? 
Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?

RandomClue.java
1: Didnt get answer in under 20 guesses.
2: 1 out of 20
3: 1 out of 20
What is good or bad about this strategy?
Not very efficient

mySolution.java
Theory 1: Got on 20th try every time.
Theory 2: Got on 1st try every time.
Theory 3: 20 out of 20
